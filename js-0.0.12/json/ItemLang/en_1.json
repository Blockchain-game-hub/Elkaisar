He introduced the Romans to the chief schools of Greek philosophy and created a Latin philosophical vocabulary, distinguishing himself as a linguist, translator, and philosopher. An impressive orator and successful lawyer, Cicero probably thought his political career was his most important achievement. Today, he is appreciated primarily for his humanism and philosophical and political writings. His voluminous correspondence, much of it addressed to his friend Atticus, has been especially influential, introducing the art of refined letter writing to European culture. Cornelius Nepos, the 1st-century BC biographer of Atticus, remarked that Cicero's letters contained such a wealth of detail \"concerning the inclinations of leading men, the faults of the generals, and the revolutions in the government\" that their reader had little need for a history of the period.",

Xerxes had amassed a huge army and navy, and set out to conquer all of Greece. The Athenian general Themistocles had proposed that the Allied Greeks block the advance of the Persian army at the pass of Thermopylae.\nAn Allied force of approximately 7,000 men thus marched north to block the pass in the summer of 480 BC. The Persian army, alleged by the ancient sources to have numbered in the millions, arrived at the pass in late August or early September. Vastly outnumbered, the Greeks held off the Persians for seven days in total (including three of battle), before the rear-guard was annihilated in one of history's most famous last stands. During two full days of battle, the small force led by King Leonidas I of Sparta blocked the only road by which the massive Persian army could pass.\nBoth ancient and modern writers have used the Battle of Thermopylae as an example of the power of a patriotic army of freemen defending native soil. The performance of the defenders at the battle of Thermopylae is also used as an example of the advantages of training, equipment, and good use of terrain as force multipliers and has become a symbol of courage against overwhelming odds.",

I.4, c. Verr. III.5). The emperor Nero was the first who built a public gymnasium at Rome (Sueton. Ner. 12); another was erected by Commodus (Herod. I.12.4). But although these institutions were intended to introduce Greek gymnastics among the Romans, they never gained any great importance, as the magnificent thermae, amphitheatres, and other colossal buildings had always greater charms for the Romans than the gymnasia.",

On other occasions, he refers only to that territory inhabited by the Celtic peoples known to the Romans as Gauls, from the English Channel to Lugdunum (Lyon).\nThe account has often been used in teaching Latin. It begins with the common phrase \"Gallia est omnis divisa in partes tres\" (sometimes quoted as \"Omnia Gallia in tres partes divisa est\" for \"All Gaul is divided into three parts\"). The full work is divided into 8 sections, Book 1 to Book 8, each varying in size from approximately 5,000 to 15,000 words. Book 8 was written by Aulus Hirtius after Caesar's death.",

The collision between the fractious political world of the Greeks and the enormous empire of the Persians began when Cyrus the Great conquered Ionia in 547 BC. Struggling to rule the independently-minded cities of Ionia, the Persians appointed tyrants to rule each of them. This would prove the source of much trouble for both Greeks and Persians alike.\nAlmost all the primary sources for the Greco-Persian Wars are Greek; the Persians do not appear to have written anything identifiable as a history of their own. By some distance, the main source for the Greco-Persian Wars is the Greek historian Herodotus. Herodotus, who has been called the \"Father of History\", was born in 484 BC in Halicarnassus, Asia Minor (then under Persian overlordship). He wrote his 'Enquiries' (Greek—Historia; English—(The) Histories) around 440—430 BC, trying to trace the origins of the Greco-Persian Wars, which would still have been relatively recent history. Herodotus's approach was entirely novel, and at least in Western society, he does seem to have invented 'history' as a discipline. As Holland has it: \"For the first time, a chronicler set himself to trace the origins of a conflict not to a past so remote as to be utterly fabulous, nor to the whims and wishes of some god, nor to a people's claim to manifest destiny, but rather explanations he could verify personally.\"",

Historians have traditionally divided the war into three phases. In the first phase, the Archidamian War, Sparta launched repeated invasions of Attica, while Athens took advantage of its naval supremacy to raid the coast of the Peloponnese attempting to suppress signs of unrest in its empire. This period of the war was concluded in 421 BC, with the signing of the Peace of Nicias. That treaty, however, was soon undermined by renewed fighting in the Peloponnese. In 415 BC, Athens dispatched a massive expeditionary force to attack Syracuse in Sicily; the attack failed disastrously, with the destruction of the entire force, in 413 BC. This ushered in the final phase of the war, generally referred to either as the Decelean War, or the Ionian War. In this phase, Sparta, now receiving support from Persia, supported rebellions in Athens' subject states in the Aegean Sea and Ionia, undermining Athens' empire, and eventually depriving the city of naval supremacy. The destruction of Athens' fleet at Aegospotami effectively ended the war, and Athens surrendered in the following year.\nThe Peloponnesian War reshaped the Ancient Greek world. On the level of international relations, Athens, the strongest city-state in Greece prior to the war's beginning, was reduced to a state of near-complete subjection, while Sparta became established as the leading power of Greece. The economic costs of the war were felt all across Greece; poverty became widespread in the Peloponnese, while Athens found itself completely devastated, and never regained its pre-war prosperity. The war also wrought subtler changes to Greek society; the conflict between democratic Athens and oligarchic Sparta, each of which supported friendly political factions within other states, made civil war a common occurrence in the Greek world. \nGreek warfare, meanwhile, originally a limited and formalized form of conflict, was transformed into an all-out struggle between city-states, complete with atrocities on a large scale. Shattering religious and cultural taboos, devastating vast swathes of countryside, and destroying whole cities, the Peloponnesian War marked the dramatic end to the fifth-century-B.C. golden age of Greece.",

Most important of all, Arrian had the biography of Alexander by Ptolemy, one of Alexander's leading generals and possibly his half-brother.\nIt is primarily a military history, it has little to say about Alexander's personal life, his role in Greek politics or the reasons why the campaign against Persia was launched in the first place.",

Early uses were connected with magic, medicine, religion, tradition, and preservation.\nThe ancient Indian epic of Ramayana mentions cloves.

Their wines were also, in keeping with the reputation of the excess known to mark their culture, high in alcohol content.\nThe Romans were well educated in the different grape varieties and the different regions from which they came.

Wool fibers from wild goats found in a prehistoric cave in the Republic of Georgia as far back 34,000 BCE suggest that wool fabrics were made even earlier than this.\nIn Roman times, wool, linen, and leather clothed the European population; the cotton of India was a curiosity that only naturalists had heard of; and silk, imported along the Silk Road from China, was an extravagant luxury. Pliny the Elder records in his Natural History that the reputation for producing the finest wool was enjoyed by Tarentum, where selective breeding had produced sheep with a superior fleece, but which required special care.",

Although Justinian may have wanted to save the cost of importing, the passage from Procopius first mentions the desire not to trade with the enemy -- the Persians.\nThe story Procopius tells is that some (Nestorian) monks from Sogdiana who knew Justinian didn't want to buy silk from the Persians, told him that they could arrange it so that he would no longer have to buy from any other nation. They told him that it was impossible to bring the silkworms themselves from \"Serinda\" (an area north of India, i.e., China), but it was possible to take their offspring, cocoons, buried in dung. After Justinian promised to reward the monks well, they did as they had described, and brought the Chinese silkworms to the Roman Empire where the newly-hatched worms fed on mulberry leaves.",

It became very valuable.\nLater, many peoples such as the Chinese, the Greeks and the Romans used it as padding under heavy armour, or to stop arrows. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the art of making felt was lost in Western Europe for a very long time.",

The burned incense may be intended as a sacrificial offering to various deities or to serve as an aid in prayer.\nIncense (Latin: incendere, \"to burn\") is composed of aromatic biotic materials, which release fragrant smoke when burned. The term incense refers to the substance itself, rather than to the odor that it produces.\nMany religious ceremonies and spiritual purificatory rites employ incense, a practice that persists to this day. Incense is also used in medicine and for its aesthetic value. The forms taken by incense have changed with advances in technology, differences in the underlying culture, and diversity in the reasons for burning it.\nIt was used in Egypt, where the gums and resins of aromatic trees were imported from the Arabian and Somali coasts to be used in religious ceremonies. It was also used by the Pharaohs, not only to counteract unpleasant odors, but also to drive away demons and gratify the presence of the gods, as they believed.",
